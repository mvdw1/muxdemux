Here a summary is listed with version info

Version     | Summary/issues
v0.1        | First version to test out the layout/stack up. Initial tests show it works well: can copy atleast 1GB in 3-3.5 seconds through the muxdemux between PC and Sandisk USB drive: without the muxdemux similar throughput 
              is achieved.
              Known issues: USB connector footprint chassis mounts in wrong location, need to be cut off. OTG not determined to be working yet
v0.3        | Second (ordered) version, to be tested. After HW arrives and it works, the design files will be updated
